	This is still a motherfucking website.

And it's more fucking perfect than the last guy's.
Seriously, it takes minimal fucking effort to improve this shit.

7 fucking declarations.

That's how much CSS it took to turn that grotesque pile of shit into this easy-to-read masterpiece. It's so fucking simple and it still has all the glory of the original perfect-ass website:

Shit's still lightweight and loads fast
Still fits on all your shitty screens
Still looks the same in all your shitty browsers
The motherfucker's still accessible to every asshole that visits your site
Shit's still legible and gets your fucking point across
And guess what, motherfucker:

You never knew it, but it's easy to improve readability on your site. Here's how.

Let it breathe

Look at lines 1 and 2 of some shitty website you're building. Assuming they're not married they probably shouldn't be humping. The defaults are trash -- pick a minimum line-height: 1.4 for body copy. Headings should be tighter. If you can't see that...piss off.

If your text hits the side of the browser, fuck off forever. You ever see a book like that? Yes? What a shitty book.

A little less contrast
